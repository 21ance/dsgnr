# Dsgnr Landing Page

A sample landing page. The design if from [Figma Community](https://www.figma.com/community/file/1175007259106121022) in which I translated into code and is responsive on all viewports.

I used ReactJS which is definitely overkill and unnecessary for this project in order to refresh my knowledge - since I took a short break from coding before this.
